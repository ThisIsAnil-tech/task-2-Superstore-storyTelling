## 💡 Key Business Insights
Based on the visualizations, here are the main "story" takeaways:

1.  **Profitability Issues:** While "Tables" and "Bookcases" (Sub-Categories) drive high sales volume, they are generating negative profit, suggesting a need to re-evaluate pricing or discounts for these items.
2.  **Regional Performance:** The West region is the strongest performer in both Sales and Profit, whereas the South region lags behind.
3.  **Customer Segments:** The "Consumer" segment accounts for the majority of sales (approx. 50%), indicating our primary marketing focus should remain B2C.
4.  **Seasonal Trends:** Sales consistently spike in Q4 (November/December), aligning with holiday trends.
